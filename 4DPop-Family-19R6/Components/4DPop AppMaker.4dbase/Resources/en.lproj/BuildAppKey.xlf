Note: It is generally not recommended to install merged applications in the "Program Files" folder under Windows since this folder includes specific mechanisms that are incompatible with the functioning of 4D applications.
When these keys are set to True and the "updater" program attempts to update an applications in a protected location, a warning dialog box informs you that administrator privileges are required.
